# Understanding Penetration Testing Methodology

## Introduction

Penetration testing methodologies serve as structured frameworks that guide security professionals in conducting effective and repeatable penetration tests. Acting like a blueprint or recipe, these methodologies ensure consistent results, help maintain quality, and provide a common language and process for testers and stakeholders. In this note, we will explore well-established penetration testing methodologies and the general phases common to most of them.

## Popular Penetration Testing Methodologies

Several organizations and bodies have developed comprehensive methodologies, each with its own structure and focus. Below are four widely adopted penetration testing frameworks:

### 1. OSSTMM – Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual

- Created by ISECOM and last updated in 2010.
- Focuses on scientific and operational approaches to security testing.
- Key features:
  - Channel testing and trust metrics
  - Adaptable and accessible guides
  - Actionable and verifiable results for improving operational security

**Quote from OSSTMM:**  
> "This manual provides test cases that result in verified facts… By using OSSTMM you no longer have to rely on general best practices, anecdotal evidence, or superstitions."

### 2. OWASP – Open Worldwide Application Security Project

- A nonprofit foundation aimed at improving software security.
- Best known for the **OWASP Top 10**, a list of common web application vulnerabilities.
- Key resources:
  - **Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)**
  - **Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)**
- Covers:
  - Web, mobile, API, and IoT testing
  - Structured testing and reporting framework

Although OWASP Top 10 is not a complete methodology, it is a critical checklist for application-focused penetration testing.

### 3. PTES – Penetration Testing Execution Standard

- Created by a global team of experienced security consultants.
- Structured into seven core phases:
  - Pre-engagement Interactions
  - Intelligence Gathering
  - Threat Modeling
  - Vulnerability Analysis
  - Exploitation
  - Post Exploitation
  - Reporting
- PTES also provides **Technical Guidelines**, covering tools, techniques, and procedures for in-depth penetration testing.

### 4. CREST – Council for Registered Ethical Security Testers

- Internationally recognized certification and accreditation body.
- Focuses on high-quality and consistent security testing standards.
- Offers:
  - Penetration testing certification for professionals and organizations
  - Compliance-driven methodology and rigorous assessments
- Especially relevant in Europe and for government/compliance-based testing.

## General Penetration Testing Phases

Despite their differences, most methodologies follow a similar process. Below are five essential stages every penetration tester should master:

### 1. Intelligence Gathering (Reconnaissance)

- Identify open ports, services, and technologies.
- Tools: Nmap, Masscan, ZMap, Amass, Recon-ng
- Goal: Build a profile of the target environment.

### 2. Threat Modeling

- Analyze gathered intelligence to identify potential attack paths.
- Consider external factors like location or environment (e.g., ATM in a bank vs. parking lot).

### 3. Vulnerability Analysis

- Match discovered systems and services to known vulnerabilities.
- Resources: Exploit-DB, Metasploit Framework

### 4. Exploitation

- Attempt to compromise systems using identified vulnerabilities.
- Demonstrates real-world impact of the vulnerabilities.

### 5. Post Exploitation

- Perform additional activities after a successful compromise:
  - Data exfiltration
  - Lateral movement
  - Privilege escalation (e.g., root, admin)

## Conclusion

In summary, penetration testing methodologies such as OSSTMM, OWASP, PTES, and CREST provide structure, repeatability, and thoroughness in security testing. Each offers unique strengths suited to different environments—from network security to web application testing.

### Call to Action

As an aspiring or professional penetration tester:

- Begin by mastering foundational methodologies like OSSTMM and PTES.
- Use OWASP resources to deepen your knowledge of application testing and bug bounty hunting.
- Review your testing process regularly to identify weaknesses and improve your craft.

By committing to a structured approach, you not only enhance the quality of your assessments but also gain credibility and confidence as a cybersecurity professional.
